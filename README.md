# About

Country Hotel is a fictional, family run hotel company. The company owns a hotel in the heart of the British countryside. As a small family run business, the publicity of the company had been only via other media outlets, social media, local phone books and the like. The family have decided, to expand the business, by creating their own website to publicise and promote their hot and services. The decision was to create their own front-end website.

# Design

### Colour Scheme

I designed my colour scheme, based on the Country Hotel logo. For the logo design I used the website [Canva](https://www.canva.com/). Based on the colour of the logo I have designed the website.

- I have used `#425B58` for the dark text in the light background sections of the web pages.
- I have used `#E7D49E` for the light text in the dark background sections of the web pages.
- I have used `#E7D49E` for the light background small sections of the web pages.
- I have used `#425B58` for the dark background sections of the web pages.
- I have used `#FAFADD` for the light background large sections of the web pages.
- I have used `#425B58` for the opaque overlay of bright images.
- I have used `#425B58` for the dark borders.
- I have used `#E7D49E` for the light borders.
- I have used `#927242` for the darker brown text.
- I have used `#2E3F3D` for the darker footer background.
- I have used `#FFFFFF` for the main body background.

### Typography

The fonts used in this website are KoHo and Questrial, both these fonts were suggested for the logo by [Canva](https://www.canva.com/). These fonts work well together. I used KoHo in uppercase for the headers and for the rest of the text across the website I have used Questrial.
Both fonts are imported from google fonts [KoHo](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/KoHo?query=koho) and [Questrial](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Questrial?query=quest) they are used via the import link at the head of the [stylesheet](assets/css/style.css), this links all the text across the pages of the website to the appropriate style and font.

### Imagery

As the website is for country hotel, which is located in the heart of the Yorkshire Dales. I have used a beutiful image of the Yorkshire landscape for the hero image. This image as all the images in the website, is downloaded with a full license from [piaxabay](https://pixabay.com/photos/country-countryside-dales-england-21460/). The hero image of the hotel page is from [pixabay](https://pixabay.com/photos/hotel-country-hotel-house-896569/) this is a typical British Manor house converted into a hotel. The hero image for the restaurant page is also downloaded from [pixabay](https://pixabay.com/photos/table-bar-restaurant-drink-food-3084384/).

### Features

The website is comprised of a home page, a hotel page, a restaurant page, a booking page & a booking confirmation page.

All Pages on the website are responsive and have:

* A favicon in the browser tab.

  ![favicon](assets/favicon/country-hotel-favicon.ico)

* The title of the site at the top of every page. This title also acts as a link back to the home page.

The home page of Country Hotel displays the sites name/logo as a title and then a nav bar shows the links to the other pages. on mobile the links are located in the dropdown.

Below the hero image are two images with titles, these are links one for the hotel page the other for the restaurant page. they are more interactive and will catch the attention of the user. Below is the main information section, below that is the location section, this consists of the address, and an iframe with a goole map. After that is the reveiw section, where previous guests have lesft a star rating and a reveiw. This brings the page to the footer, the footer has three columns (on mobile they are laid out vertically) the first is logo link which brings the user to th top pf the page. The second is contact information and the third column has the social media links.

### Accessibility

I have been mindful during coding to ensure that the website is as accessible friendly as possible. This has been have achieved by:

* Using semantic HTML.
* Using a hover state on all buttons on the site to make it clear to the user if they are hovering over a button.
* Choosing a sans serif font for the site - these fonts are suitable for people with dyslexia.
* Ensuring that there is a sufficient colour contrast throughout the site.

## Bugs

| No | Bug | How I fixed the bug |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | The active class on the nav section was a border-bottom solid line, the line was not symmetrical  below each of nav elements. | I changed the active class, by giving each list item, a backgrond colour darker than the nav bar. |
| 2 | The drop-down elements in the navbar, did not dispaly properly on mobile and tablet. The information was blocked by the next list item. | After trying out a various ideas, I realised the drop-down information was only blocked by the second drop-down link, and not by the next nav-item. I then changed the order of the nav links, now one drop-down did not drop over the other. |
| 3 | After I changed the order of the nav links the symmetry of the whole nav bar looked odd on desktop. | I decided to create two nav links for navigation to resturant.html one after both dropdown links for desktop, using the .d bootstrap class I made this one visible only for desktop. The second link to restaurant.html I placed between the dropdown links and using the .d bootstrap class made it visible only for mobile and tablet. |
| 4 | On restaurant.html I used bootstraps row and col classes to create the information article, the chef info in one column and the genaral info in a second column. After I finished the styling of the chef info and strated with the general info, it came out below the chef info even on desktop. | I spent long time checknig my code to see if I had made mistakes, I compare them to the bootstrap documentation and I could not find the reason for the bug. I tested the link to bootstrap it was working. I then used Devtools and checked multiple times, I relised eventually that the class chef-about which styles the chef info paragraph, I had inserted into the main div of the column (together with the bootstrap class). The chef-about class creates a box whoch is smaller than the overall column width, this therefore caused the next column to start at the edge of the column which was below the chef info. I fixed the bug by creating a separate div for the chef-about class, the main column therefore, used the full width of the page. this gave the space for the next column to start beside the first, rather than under it. |
| 5 | Horizontal scrolling. | Using devtools I deleted elemnets of the affected pages one by one, untill the horizontal scroll had dissapeared. Then by process of elimination I determined which element was causing the horizontal overflow. Once I figured out the cause I computed the size if each child element of the affected element untill I worked out which was too wide, I then adjusted the width to fit the page.|
| 6 | Fixed navbar blocks hero image. | I created a div above the the hero image and gave it a height of 120px, this pushed down th hero image. The navbar only covers the div and not the hero image. |
| 7 | The fixed navbar made the elements in the page look messy, they were the same colour as the navbar but have different widths. When scrolling down the moing elements toucjing the navbar crated an uneven edge to the navbar. | I gave the navbar a bottom border of 3px with  darker colour, this gave the navbar an appearance of being above the ret of the page on the z-index. |
| 8 | When testing the page on  a wider device the info box in the hero image was not centered. | I researched the topic of parent and child ivs and I found the best and most relavant way to center a child in a parent, by using the flexbox in css. this I found in a blog by [openreplay](https://blog.openreplay.com/five-css-ways-of-centering-a-child-in-its-parent/). |
